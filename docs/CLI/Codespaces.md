[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)  is  a [cloud-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)  that provides pre-configured [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)  for coding without the need for software installation or configuration. 



## Benefits of using Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces offers a pre-configured, cloud-based, efficient, and secure environment for coding.




## How to get started with Codespaces?

To create a GitHub Codespaces environment, one needs to have a GitHub account and [follow these steps on the Codespaces page](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart). 

Once your Codespaces environment is created, you can connect to it from your web browser or from the GitHub app.


## The Codespaces lifecycle

When you create a [new Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/the-codespace-lifecycle), all your files and work can be stored in your codespace. The coding space is executing while you are working and should be stopped when you finish your session. 

You need to restart the previous codespace when continuing in the following session. A codespace can be deleted if no longer needed. 



## Code developing in Codespaces

There are several options to work with codespaces. In this tutorial, we recomend working with Visual Studio Code (aka _VSCode_). This can be done [directly in your browser](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace#working-in-a-codespace-in-the-browser) or using a locally installed  [desktop version of VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).



## VSCode Extensions

One of the advantages of VSCode is that many extensions are available for facilitating your code development. The main feature is that it very well integrated with Github, has many plugins to support software development in a wide variety of programming languages and includes a Terminal for interacting with the underlaying Operating System (UNIX/Linux).
