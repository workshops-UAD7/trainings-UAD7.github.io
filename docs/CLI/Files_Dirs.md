# Working with files and directories

In this section we will focus on files and directories.

In Unix, files and directories are similar

A [computer file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file) is a named collection of data that is stored on a computer's hard drive or other storage device. Files can contain text, images, audio, video, and other types of data. Files are typically opened and closed using a file manager or other software application.

A [directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)) is a named collection of files and other directories. Directories are used to organize files and make them easier to find. Directories are typically opened and closed using a file manager or other software application.

## Similarities and differences between files and Directories

### Similarities

* Both files and directories are stored on the same physical disk.
* Both files and directories have names.
* Both files and directories can be owned by users and groups.
* Both files and directories can have permissions set on them.
* Both files and directories can be accessed using the same commands.

### Differences

* A file is a collection of data, while a directory is a collection of files.
* A file cannot contain other files, while a directory can contain other files and directories.
* A file can be accessed directly by its name, while a directory can only be accessed by navigating to it through the file system hierarchy.
