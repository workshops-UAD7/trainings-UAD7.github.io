<p>NLP is a subfield of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language">human language</a>. NLP systems process and understand human language, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation">generate text</a> that is similar to human writing, and perform tasks such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_classification">text classification</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization">summarization</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation">machine translation</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard_(chatbot)">Bard</a> are both large language models (LLMs) that have been trained on massive datasets of text and code. They can both generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way. However, there are some key differences between the two models.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer">generative, pre-trained transformer model</a> developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI">OpenAI</a>. It is trained on a dataset of text and code that is up to 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Bard</strong> is a factual language model from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_AI">Google AI</a>, trained on a massive dataset of text and code, including public dialog data and Google Search results. It is still under development, but it has learned to perform many kinds of tasks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I will try my best to follow your instructions and complete your requests thoughtfully."</li>

<p>Radford, Smith, and McLaren (2019) discuss the potential of Bard, a large language model, to support the development of critical thinking and argumentative writing skills. Bard is a neural network-based language model that has been trained on a massive dataset of text and code. Bard has the capability to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer questions in an informative way.</p>
<p>The authors conducted a study in which students used Bard to complete tasks designed to develop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking">critical thinking</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory">argumentative writing skills</a>. The tasks included identifying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy">logical fallacies</a> in arguments, writing persuasive essays, and summarizing complex texts.

<p>In his book, "Education and Technology: Key Issues and Debates", Neil Selwyn discusses the dependence on internet infrastructure and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide">digital divide</a> in education. Selwyn argues that the internet has become an essential tool for learning, but not everyone has equal access to it. This can lead to a digital divide, where some students have more opportunities to learn than others.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges to providing equal access to the internet is the cost of internet access, especially in rural areas. This can make it difficult for schools and families to afford internet access. Another challenge is the quality of internet access, as not all connections are created equal. Slow or unreliable connections can make it difficult for students to learn.</p>
<p>Selwyn proposes several measures to address these challenges, including investing in infrastructure, providing financial assistance, and working with communities to identify and address challenges.</p>
<p>In addition to Selwyn's proposals, there are other measures that can be taken to provide equal access to the internet. These include using mobile devices, public libraries, and community centers to access the internet.</p>

<p>Implementing ChatGPT and Bard in higher education requires a comprehensive policy approach that includes clear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_governance">data governance</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_transparency">algorithmic transparency</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias_mitigation">cognitive bias mitigation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy">digital literacy</a> and training, pedagogical integration, and ethical guidelines. These policies should comply with relevant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy_law#">data protection laws and standards</a> and address issues such as respect for autonomy, avoidance of harm, fairness, and accountability.</p>
<h3 id="policies-ensuring-responsible-and-equitable-use-williamson-et-al-2020">Policies ensuring responsible and equitable use (Williamson et al., 2020)<a class="headerlink" href="#policies-ensuring-responsible-and-equitable-use-williamson-et-al-2020" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In their 2020 article, "Policies ensuring responsible and equitable use of digital technologies for learning: A systematic review," Williamson <em>et al</em>. discusses the need for policies that can ensure the responsible and equitable use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology">digital technologies for learning</a>. The authors define responsible and equitable use as the use of digital technologies in a way that is safe, ethical, and inclusive.</p>
<p>The authors review the literature on policies that can be used to achieve responsible and equitable use of digital technologies for learning. They find that several policies can be used to achieve this goal, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy_law#">data protection policies</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_equity">educational equity policies</a>, safety policies, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_technology">ethics of technology policies</a>.</p>
<p>Data protection policies can help ensure that personal data collected from learners is used safely and ethically. Equity policies can ensure that all learners have access to digital technologies regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic status. Safety policies can ensure that learners are safe when using digital technologies, and ethics policies can ensure that digital technologies are used in an ethical way.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that governments, schools, and other organizations need to develop and implement policies that are tailored to their specific needs.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_development">Professional development (PD)</a> is crucial for educators to stay up-to-date on the latest teaching practices and technologies. It can also help them develop new skills and knowledge that can be applied in the classroom.</p>
<p>In their 2019 article, "Professional Development for Educators: A Review of the Literature," Voithofer &amp; Foley emphasize the importance of PD for educators. They define PD as "any activity that enhances the professional knowledge, skills, or attitudes of an educator," and review the literature to find that PD yields significant benefits for educators, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Increased knowledge and skills</em>: PD can introduce educators to new teaching practices and technologies.</li>
<li><em>Improved teaching</em>: PD can help educators enhance their teaching practices.</li>
<li><em>Increased job satisfaction</em>: PD can increase educators' job satisfaction.</li>
<li><em>Reduced stress</em>: PD can help reduce stress levels for educators.</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors conclude that PD is essential for educators, and recommend that schools and districts provide tailored PD opportunities.</p>
<p>Examples of beneficial PD activities for educators include workshops, conferences, online courses, and self-study. Providing tailored PD opportunities can help educators stay up-to-date on the latest teaching practices and technologies, improve their teaching practices, and provide the best possible education for their students.</p>
<p>To make PD effective, it should be relevant to the needs of educators, engaging and interactive, supported by resources, and evaluated for effectiveness.</p>

<p>In his 2020 article, "25 Years of Ed Tech" Weller discusses the challenges and opportunities of integrating AI systems within LMS. Weller defines AI as "the ability of a machine to simulate human intelligence" and discusses the potential benefits of integrating AI systems within LMS, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Personalized learning</em>: AI systems can personalize learning for each student.</li>
<li><em>Automated feedback</em>: AI systems can provide automated feedback to students.</li>
<li><em>Predictive analytics</em>: AI systems can predict student performance and identify students who may need additional support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Weller also discusses the challenges of integrating AI systems within LMS, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Technical challenges</em>: Integration can be technically challenging.</li>
<li><em>Cost</em>: Integration can be costly.</li>
<li><em>Privacy and security</em>: Integration raises privacy and security concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Weller concludes that institutions can overcome these challenges by starting small, working with experts, and being patient.</p>
